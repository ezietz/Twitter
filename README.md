# Project 3 - *Twitter*

**Twitter** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User sees app icon in home screen and styled launch screen
- [X] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [X] User can Logout
- [X] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [X] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [X] User can pull to refresh.
- [X] User can tap the retweet and favorite buttons in a tweet cell to retweet and/or favorite a tweet.
- [X] User can compose a new tweet by tapping on a compose button.
- [X] Using AutoLayout, the Tweet cell should adjust it's layout for iPhone 7, Plus and SE device sizes as well as accommodate device rotation.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Tweet Details Page: User can tap on a tweet to view it, with controls to retweet, favorite, and reply.
- [X] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count. Refer to [[this guide|unretweeting]] for help on implementing unretweeting.
- [X] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [X] When composing, you should have a countdown for the number of characters remaining for the tweet (out of 140) (**1 point**)
- [ ] User can view their profile in a *profile tab*
  - Contains the user header view: picture and tagline
  - Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
  - [ ] Profile view should include that user's timeline
- [ ] User should display the relative timestamp for each tweet "8m", "7h"
- [ ] Links in tweets are clickable.
- [ ] User can tap the profile image in any tweet to see another user's profile
  - Contains the user header view: picture and tagline
  - Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
- [ ] After creating a new tweet, a user should be able to view it in the timeline immediately without refetching the timeline from the network.
- [ ] User can reply to any tweet, and replies should be prefixed with the username and the reply_id should be set when posting the tweet (**2 points**)
- [ ] User sees embedded images in tweet if available
- [ ] User can switch between timeline, mentions, or profile view through a tab bar (**3 points**)
- [ ] Profile Page: pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image. (**4 points**)


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Customized the UI

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. We could extend the app by embedding images in the tweet if they are available.
2. I'd also like to talk about how we can make the links in the tweets clickable.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

I found AutoLayout challenging at first, especially on the labels, but after watching the video, and clearing the constraints and trying again, I was able to understand it. Also, getting the infinite scroll view was quite hard, because I had to obtain the ID string of the tweet and reload the next 20 tweets. After reading the API documentation and talking to my pod members about it, I understood what I needed to do and was able to implement it.
